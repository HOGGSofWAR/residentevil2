# Resident Evil 2 Remake Website:

A website made for fun to experiment with mouse scrolling animations. 
Written in Atom, using Jade, Sass and Jquery with the Prepros Compiler. Adobe Photoshop was also used for editing images.

  <li>Improved confidence with Jade syntax</li>
  <li>Exposure to Atom packages</li>
</ul>
