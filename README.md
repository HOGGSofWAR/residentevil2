# Resident Evil 2 Remake Website:

A website made for fun to experiment with mouse scrolling animations. 
Written in Atom, using Jade, Sass and Jquery with the Prepros Compiler. Adobe Photoshop was also used for editing images.

# What I learned:
How to set up the Prepros compiler for Sass
Scroll events in Jquery
Improved confidence with Jade syntax
Exposure to Atom packages
